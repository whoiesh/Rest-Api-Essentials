With these implementations, you have created the necessary controllers and protected certain routes with authentication middleware (JWT). This will ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints, such as adding to the cart, removing from the cart, viewing the total bill, and confirming the order.

Please note that this implementation assumes you have implemented JWT-based authentication using a secret key. You should also consider adding additional validation and error handling as required for your specific use case.
Please note that this code assumes you've implemented the controllers, models, and routes as shown in the previous examples. Additionally, you'll need to create and manage the MongoDB database, set environment variables (if required), and handle other configurations based on your specific use case.
